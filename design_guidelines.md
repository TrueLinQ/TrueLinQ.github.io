### Component Library
**Hero Section:**
- Full viewport height with centered content

- Primary CTA button with subtle glow effect
- Background: gradient overlay with subtle geometric pattern

**Navigation:**

### Visual Treatment
**Minimalist Security Aesthetic:**

### Animations
**Minimal Motion:**

- Button hover micro-interactions
- Smooth scrolling between sections

## Images
**Hero Background:** Abstract digital security visualization - interconnected nodes or shield patterns in subtle blue tones, positioned as background overlay behind text content. The image should convey protection and connectivity without overwhelming the text.

**Supporting Graphics:** Simple iconography for features (shield icons, checkmarks, alert symbols) - use Heroicons for consistency.

## Key Design Principles

2. **Clarity Over Complexity:** Simple, focused messaging with clear hierarchy
3. **Security-Minded:** Visual elements reinforce protection and safety themes
